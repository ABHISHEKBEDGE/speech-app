    thesisTitle: 'Speech knowledge based speaker anonymization for privacy preservation',
    description: 'The speech signal is unique for each individual which enables person identification. Nowadays recorded speech signals are easily available either in the cloud or public space. This has increased the risk of using the speech signals for malafide intentions. Hence there is a need for privacy preservation with respect to the speaker identity in the speech signals. The privacy preservation can be either for human listening, machines or both. This work presents explorations made in three directions of speaker anonymization depending upon the target with whom anonymization is required: (1) Speaker anonymization for human listeners, (2) Speaker anonymization for machines and (3) Speaker anonymization for both humans and machines.',

    thesisTitle: 'Direct Speech-to-Text Translation',
    description: 'Direct Speech-to-Text Translation (DS2TT) systems have the potential to reduce error propagation as seen in Cascaded Speech-to-Text Translation (CS2TT) because of its unified architecture. However, these direct systems suffer from the complexities of mapping the source speech with the target text representations along with the scarcity of data available for training. As a result, the cascaded system still outperformed even with the compounding of error from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to the Machine Translation (MT) system. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of size and quality of data to bring the performance of DS2TT comparable to its cascaded counterpart. This study analyzed the performances between these systems by augmenting the size and by generating high-quality audios for the Prabhupadavani and MuST-C corpora along with the role of Large Acoustic Models (LAMs) in performance enhancement. Additionally, this study explored methods to document un-orthographic low-resourced tribal languages using DS2TT systems. The addition of high-quality audios and size did reduce the performance gap and the utilization of LAMs was found to be effective in bringing the performance of DS2TT systems comparable to CS2TT. The LAMs also contributed to better quality of text translation for low-resource settings. This work will further explore methods to improve the mapping of speech and text representations along with the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing DS2TT performance. Also, new techniques of audio generation using Generative AI (GenAI) will be explored for low-resourced settings.',
